# How to participate

Embark on a dynamic journey with our Adventronics Calendar – an electrifying twist on the traditional advent calendar! Instead of the usual sweet treats, each of the 24 windows reveals a challenge centered around the Barduino. Every day we will share with you in this page more details of the challenge and a possible solution, but be creative with your own solutions. These challenges encompass coding, design, and entertaining activities that you can seamlessly weave into your December routine. While the first five participants to finish the challenge will earn a coveted Barduino sweatshirt*, the true essence lies in the joy of learning, the thrill of tackling electronics, and the camaraderie of sharing your experiences with fellow participants. 

## Progress

To track your progress, share a video or photo in our dedicated [Telegram](
https://t.me/+DbXVZ22VOkI3NDVk) group using the hashtag #AdventronicsDay followed by the day's number (e.g., #AdventronicsDay05). Utilize this group to seek guidance, pose questions, and exchange insights with the vibrant community of participants. Get ready for 24 days of innovation, learning, and festive fun! :christmas_tree: :high_voltage:

## Social media

You can share it on social media tagging **@fablabbcn** and using the hashtag **#adventronics** and/or **#barduino** and we will repost so we can have a collection of challenges. 

## Schedule

Every morning the exercise for the day will be explained in this page and an example will be proposed.
